## Introduction

Hello! My name is Ryan Summers and I am a data science enthusiast with a career background in finance. I have a strong passion for using statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to derive insights and solve real-world problems.

My journey into the world of data science began in accounting, where I was initially drawn to the analytical nature of the field. However, as I gained more experience, I realized my true passion lay in exploring data and applying statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends. I began taking courses on platforms like Coursera and Udemy, and soon discovered that I had a natural aptitude for programming and statistics.

Since then, I have pursued advanced degrees in both Data Science and Statistics from Syracuse University and Penn State, respectively. Along the way, I have worked on a range of projects and built meaningful relationships that have allowed me to further hone my data analysis skills.

Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience working with large amounts of financial data and communicating complex business problems and solutions to stakeholders. I am a dedicated and passionate professional who is committed to solving problems and continuously learning and growing.

Whether you are a potential employer, collaborator, or simply someone interested in learning more about me, I hope this page has provided you with a better understanding of my background and interests. Thank you for taking the time to read my "About Me" page!
