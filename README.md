## Introduction

👋 Hi there! I'm Ryan, a finance-turned-biostatistician with a burning passion for leveraging data to improve healthcare outcomes and public policy. My journey has taken me from crunching numbers in the financial world to uncovering insights that are more meaningful and impactual to a greater number of people (other than people with deep pockets).

## My Path

🔄 Career Pivot: I made the leap from finance to biostatistics, driven by a desire to apply my analytical skills to meaningful medical research.

🏥 Recent Project: I've just wrapped up work as a statistical consultant on a fascinating retrospective study on pediatric orbital cellulitis in Colorado. This project allowed me to flex my statistical muscles, applying techniques like ANCOVA, Poisson Regression, and calculating standardized incidence rates to paint a clear picture of the population affected by this disease.

## What I Bring to the Table

💻 Tech Stack: I'm proficient in R and SAS, using these tools to wrangle data and apply advanced analytical techniques.

📊 Skills: My toolkit includes exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and data visualization. I'm also diving into the world of machine learning to expand my capabilities.

🧠 Approach: I believe in the power of evidence-based healthcare decisions and strive to provide insights that can drive meaningful change.

## What I'm Looking For

🔍 I'm on the hunt for exciting opportunities in biostatistics or data science within the medical research field. If you have a project that needs someone to turn complex data into actionable insights, I'd love to chat!
